**"book owls" is a browser app for book lovers who would easy manage their books.**

## Motivation

This project was created as part of my graduation from the neuefische coding bootcamp.\
I am a great book lover myself and can never get enough to read. So I developed an app that helps to discover and manage books quick and easy.

## Main Features

Books from the Google Books Web API are fetched and displayed appropriately. The user can search a book by title, author or ISBN to save it or look for some deatils.\
The saved books are shown in an libary. There the user can see some book-details or delete books form the libary-list.

## Mockup

## Demo

You can test the app in [this demo](https://book-owls.herokuapp.com). It is optimized for **mobile screens**.
